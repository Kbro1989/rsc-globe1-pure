## Implications for Globe 1

### What to Include
✅ **All released content through Oct 31, 2003**
- Scythe (last official item)
- All quests, skills, items through that date

### What to Exclude (For Pure Preservation)
❌ **Unreleased/Mystery Items**
- Necromancy spells
- Zamorak axe/mace
- Mystery items with unknown IDs

### What to Document
📝 **Archive for Historical Reference**
- Keep unreleased content in separate documentation
- Note which item IDs are "mystery" items
- Preserve for Globe 2+ (could add as "lost content")

## For Globe 2+ Evolution
These unreleased items could be:
1. Implemented as "discovered lost content"
2. Used as evolution features
3. Completed with modern interpretations

## Action Items
1. ✅ Document all mystery item IDs
2. ⏳ Verify which items are in our caches
3. ⏳ Flag unreleased content in code
4. ⏳ Create "authentic vs unreleased" manifest
5. ⏳ Test that client doesn't crash on mystery IDs
