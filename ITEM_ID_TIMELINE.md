# RSC Item ID Timeline Theory

## Development Phases

### Phase 1: Core Game (2001-2002)
**Item IDs: 0-30 (estimated)**
- Basic items (bronze, iron, steel equipment)
- Food, potions, runes
- Core gameplay items
- Most items were in-game by end of 2002

### Phase 2: Creative Expansion (2002-2003)
**Item IDs: 31-50+ (estimated)**
- Experimental content
- Quest-specific items
- New skills/features being tested
- **This is where unreleased content appears!**

**Known Unreleased from this period:**
- **Life Rune (ID 37)** - Necromancy/Summoning
- Time Rune, Illusion Rune, Reality Rune
- Zamorak Axe (quest item)
- Mystery items (Special Curry, Steel Wire, etc.)

### Phase 3: Final Content (2003)
**Item IDs: 50+ (estimated)**
- Shilo Village quest (Jan 2003)
- Murder Mystery (Jun 2003)
- Legends' Quest (Aug 2003)
- **Scythe (Oct 31, 2003) - LAST ITEM**

### Phase 4: RS2 Transition (Late 2003)
- RuneScape 2 development begins
- RSC frozen (no new items)
- Some planned content abandoned

## Why This Matters

### Item ID Gaps
If we see gaps in item IDs (e.g., 35, 36, 38, 39 missing but 37 exists), those are likely:
1. Unreleased content
2. Removed items
3. Developer placeholders

### For Globe 1 Preservation
**Safe Range**: Items 0-36, 38+ (excluding ID 37 - Life Rune)
- Verify each item was actually released
- Cross-reference with RSC Wiki
- Exclude any "mystery" items

### For Globe 2+ Evolution
**Unreleased Range**: ID 37 and other gaps
- Implement as "discovered lost content"
- Complete unfinished features
- Add lore about why they were abandoned

## Timeline Evidence

### 2001-2002: Foundation
- RuneScape Classic launches
- Core skills, items, quests
- Most basic content added

### 2002-2003: Experimentation
- Jagex gets creative
- Tests new skills (Summoning/Necromancy)
- Plans quests that never shipped
- **This is the "mystery item" period**

### 2003: Final Push
- Last major quests added
- Oct 31: Scythe (final item)
- RS2 development takes priority

### Late 2003-2004: Transition
- RSC frozen
- RS2 beta/launch
- Unreleased RSC content abandoned

## Hypothesis

**Items numbered 30-50 are the "experimental zone"** where Jagex was testing features that may or may not have shipped. This explains why:
- Life Rune (37) exists but was never released
- Gaps appear in item sequences
- Mystery items have no clear purpose

## Next Steps

1. Extract full item list from cache
2. Identify all gaps in numbering
3. Research each gap on RSC Wiki
4. Mark unreleased vs released
5. Create "safe" item list for Globe 1
